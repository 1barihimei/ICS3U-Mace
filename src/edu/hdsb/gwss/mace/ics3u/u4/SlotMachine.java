 * Description:
 *  This program is a slot machine simulation. 3 numbers ranging from 1-4 are randomely generated.
 *  If all three numbers are 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's, 4, 6, 8, and 10 points are awarded respectively.
 *  The user is asked if they want to continue spinning or saving their score at the end of every spin.
