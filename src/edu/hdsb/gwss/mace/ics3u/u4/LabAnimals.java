 * Description:
 *  This program simulates how much food is availale per animal in a lab. Every hour, the number of animals double
 *  and eat. Each meal is represented as 1 in the food variable. Every hour, the inputted amount of food that is
 *  to be increased is added to the amount of food and the amount of animals subtracted as they eat every hour.
 *  The program will run until the amount of animals is greater than the amount of food, meaning the food ran out.
